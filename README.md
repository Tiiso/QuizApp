# QuizApp
QuizApp is an educational biology app. It tests the users knowledge about the subject. The user will have to submit the score by clicking the "submit answer" button. Finally the user will get his/her score after submission.
Apps have to be tested on a real device to detect bugs and experience the functionality of the app. Instructions on how to deploy the app on a real device or run it on a emulator can be found on this link: https://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/running-app . 
Developers who use windows operating system might need to install OEM drivers to be able to run the app. The drivers can be found on the following link https://developer.android.com/studio/run/oem-usb. If  you are developing on Mac OS X or Ubuntu Linux you can follow this link for further instruction https://developer.android.com/studio/run/device.
The above process will install the app on your device for testing, you will have the chance to fix bugs and other issues you might have with the user experience. You can also share it with other developers or your friends to find out if there is anything they have a problem with.

The app was built with android studio.
